# Zephyr Porting on BGM220P

This project documents my journey of porting the Zephyr RTOS to the **BGM220P** board from Silicon Labs. The base reference was taken from the **SLTB010A** (official Silabs dev board) Zephyr support. The goal was to bring up basic Zephyr functionality on BGM220P and later extend to BLE stack integration.

## ðŸ§  What I Did

### âœ… Board Bring-Up
- **Reference Board**: `sltb010a` (from official Zephyr and Silabs support)
- **Target Board**: `BGM220P`
- Ported necessary DTS (Device Tree Source), pinctrl, and Kconfig files to define the board.
- Set up the board folder under `boards/arm/`.

### âœ… Basic Applications
- **Hello World**: Verified console output over UART.
- **LED Blinky**: Verified GPIO pin toggle (adapted to BGM220P pin mapping).

### ðŸš§ Next Steps (WIP)
- BLE stack integration (controller + host stack setup)
- GATT server sample
- Power management optimization

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Zephyr SDK**
- **west** (Zephyr meta-tool for managing repos and builds)
---

## ðŸ§­ How to Build & Flash

Make sure west is initialized and Zephyr SDK is set up.

          west build -b sltb010a --pristine

run this in the zephyrproject/zephyr

# Flash the binary (adjust to your flashing tool)
           west flash

 # Notes         
BGM220P is not officially supported in upstream Zephyr, so board support is manually added.

LED and UART pins were mapped manually using BGM220P datasheet + schematic.

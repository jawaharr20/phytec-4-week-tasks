# Week 2 Tasks – Phytec Internship

This folder contains all the tasks and progress for **Week 2** of the Phytec Embedded & IoT Internship Program.  
It includes logical programming practice, flowcharts, and my day-to-day work on porting **Zephyr RTOS** to the **BGM220P** board.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

### 🔹 C Logical Programs
- Simple to intermediate C tasks to build strong fundamentals.
- Topics include: conditionals, loops, switch cases, arrays, functions, etc.

### 🔹 C Flowchart Programs
- Flowchart-based implementation of logic before coding.
- Reinforces structured programming and algorithm planning.

### 🔹 Zephyr Porting (BGM220P)
- Porting of Zephyr RTOS from Silicon Labs `sltb010a` board to `BGM220P`.
- Includes:
  - Custom board files (DTS, Kconfig, pinctrl)
  - Basic samples like `hello_world` and `led_blinky`
  - BLE stack integration in progress
- Full details: [zephyr_porting README](zephyr_porting/README.md)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- BLE features for BGM220P (GATT server, advertising)
- Power management with Zephyr on BGM220P
- More flowchart-based programs and embedded exercises coming soon

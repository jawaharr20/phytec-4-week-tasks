The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking systems communicate with each other. It divides the process of network communication into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions. The layers are:

    Physical Layer:
    Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium (cables, radio, etc.).
    
    Data Link Layer:
    Handles error detection and correction from the physical layer, and frames data for transmission.
    
    Network Layer:
    Manages data routing, forwarding, and addressing (e.g., IP addresses).
    
    Transport Layer:
    Ensures reliable data transfer, error recovery, and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).
    
    Session Layer: 
    Manages sessions or connections between applications.
    
    Presentation Layer:
    Translates data between the application and network format (encryption, compression, etc.).
    
    Application Layer: 
    Provides network services directly to user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

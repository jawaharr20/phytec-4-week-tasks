# State Machine in C

This project implements a simple state machine in C. The code is located at state_machine.c.
Features

    Demonstrates a basic state machine structure in C
    Useful for learning and embedded systems tasks

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    GCC or any standard C compiler

Compilation

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing state_machine.c. Then run:


       gcc  state_machine.c -o  state_machine

This will create an executable named state_machine.
Running the Program

Run the compiled executable:


      ./state_machine

How it Works

    The program defines different states and transitions between them based on user input or logic.
    You can modify the state_machine.c file to add more states or transitions as needed.

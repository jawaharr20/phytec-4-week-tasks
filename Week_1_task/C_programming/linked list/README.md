# Linked List Programs â€“ Week 1 Task


This directory contains C programs demonstrating various operations on linked lists as part of the Week 1 tasks for the PHYTEC 4-week program.
Contents

Typical C files you may find here:

    Creating a linked list
    Inserting nodes (at beginning, end, or specific positions)
    Deleting nodes
    Displaying the list
    Searching for elements

How to Run

  Clone the repository (if not already):
    
    
       git clone https://github.com/jawaharr20/phytec-4-week-tasks.git
       
then
       
        cd phytec-4-week-tasks/Week_1_task/C_programming/linked\ list

Compile the C files: You can compile any of the C files using gcc. For example, if you have a file called linkedlist.c:
bash

      gcc  linkedlist.c -o linkedlist

Run the compiled program:
bash

      ./linkedlist

What Happens

Each program demonstrates different linked list operations. When you run a program:

    You may be prompted to enter data to add to the list.
    The program will perform functions such as:
        Insertion and deletion of nodes
        Traversing and displaying the linked list
        Searching for specific values
    Outputs will be printed to the terminal, showing the current state of the linked list after each operation.

Requirements

    GCC compiler (install with sudo apt install build-essential on Ubuntu)
    Basic knowledge of compiling and running C programs

Example
bash

     gcc -o linkedlist linkedlist.c
     ./linkedlist

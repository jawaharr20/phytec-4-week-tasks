# C Programming Tasks - Week 1

This directory contains C programming tasks completed as part of Week 1 for the PHYTEC 4-Week Training Program.

## Overview

The tasks in this folder aim to build a strong foundation in C programming. Each task is designed to reinforce key concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers.

## Folder Structure

- Each `.c` file corresponds to a specific assignment or practice problem.
- Files are named according to their purpose or task number for easy reference.

## Getting Started

To compile and run any of the C programs:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory.
3. Compile a program using:
   ```sh
        gcc filename.c -o outputname
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
         ./outputname
   ```
